JavaScript logic (brief):

When the page finishes loading, grab the password input and checkbox.
Listen for checkbox change events.
If the box is checked, set the password field’s type to text; otherwise set it to password. This instantly shows or hides the characters.


Deploy to GitHub Pages:

Push these three files to a GitHub repo (root level).
In the repo, go to Settings → Pages.
Source: choose the default branch (e.g., main) and root folder, then save.
Wait a minute; the site will appear at https://<username>.github.io/<repo-name>/.
